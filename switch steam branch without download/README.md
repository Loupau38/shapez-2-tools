A tool to switch the selected branch on a steam game without having to redownload the files by storing a local copy of every branch's files.

You can either use the `.py` or `.exe` version (i.e. no need to download both).

Only tested for shapez 2 on my computer but supposedly should work for any game on any computer.

Don't hesitate to contact me if it doesn't work for you.
