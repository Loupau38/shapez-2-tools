A tool to view and edit base64 encoded bytes, useful for entry additional data in blueprint codes

Usage :
- The buttons on the top and bottom allow you to respectively load base64 encoded bytes from your clipboard and copy the current bytes base64 encoded to your clipboard
- Bytes in the list show up from top to bottom then from left to right
- Each byte has 3 sections :
  - The first shows the ascii character representing the byte, type an ascii character while hovering this section to replace the byte with it
  - The second shows the byte's hex and int representation, use the scroll wheel while hovering this section to increment or decrement the number
  - The third shows the byte's binary representation, click any of the bits to toggle them
- Additionally, at the end of the byte list, a '+' button allows to add a byte to the list and each byte has a 'X' button in the top right allowing to delete that byte from the list
