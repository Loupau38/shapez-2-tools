**How to use**
- If you are using the exe version, simply download `OL tracker.exe`
- If you are using the python version, download everything except `OL tracker.exe` and `README.md`. You will also need [shapez2](https://pypi.org/project/shapez2/) and [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/).

In the saves selection screen, the number of backups setting controls how many savegame backups will be used to calculate the shape delivery rates. A bigger number means more data so potentially more precision, but also the risk that if you had less production in earlier versions of your save, it would lower the average throughput.
