== Task Lists ==

Tasks are divided into their respective scenarios.

The number of shapes required to complete each task, as well as the rewards for completing each task vary depending on the Goal Multiplier, the Copy/Paste Cost, and the Platform Limit selected through the [[Game Modes#Difficulties| Difficulty]] setting. The numbers provided in the following sections are for each of these settings at 100%. If Copy/Paste is free and/or the Platform Limit is unlimited, the respective rewards will not be shown or awarded.
