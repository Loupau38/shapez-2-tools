**Moved to https://github.com/Loupau38/shapez2-python/tree/main/shapez2/gameCode. This folder won't be updated if there are changes in the ingame code.**

Snippets of the game's code recreated in python.

Requires the [fixedint library](https://pypi.org/project/fixedint/)

- `ConsistentRandom.py`, `MapShapeGenerator.py`, `otherClasses.py` and `RandomResearchShapeGenerator.py` recreate the game's code
- `shapeOperations.py` is taken from [ShapeBot 2](https://github.com/tobspr-games/shapez-2-discord-bot) and recreates the shape operations code
- `ingameValues.py` provides the values used ingame for some of the dataclasses
- `ROSdemo.py` provides some sample code on how to use the ROS algorithm
